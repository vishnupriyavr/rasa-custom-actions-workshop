WARNING! dev mode is enabled! In this mode, Vault runs entirely in-memory
and starts unsealed with a single unseal key. The root token is already
authenticated to the CLI, so you can immediately begin using Vault.
You may need to set the following environment variable:
    $ export VAULT_ADDR='http://34.71.104.113:8200'
The unseal key and root token are displayed below in case you want to
seal/unseal the Vault or re-authenticate.
Unseal Key: ypI6ChF9FubspA14gAxucEPe6NuG3Q3zPGAPRgatO3M=
Root Token: s.b8O9gHcbp4Lxs0RsqFwklvHh
Development mode should NOT be used in production installations!
